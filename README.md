# Clustering
ðŸ”¹ 1. Implementing Hierarchical Clustering
This notebook performs Hierarchical Clustering on customer shopping data (shopping_data.csv). It includes the full clustering pipeline:

Data loading and exploration

Distance matrix calculation

Dendrogram visualization using scipy.cluster.hierarchy

Cutting the dendrogram to form clusters

The result is a clear demonstration of customer segmentation using agglomerative clustering, with visual outputs for cluster structure interpretation.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Implementing K-Means Clustering
Executes K-Means Clustering for unsupervised customer segmentation. The project includes:

Data preprocessing and visualization

Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

Clustering implementation with KMeans from sklearn

Final cluster visualization in 2D feature space

This notebook effectively segments customer groups based on spending behavior, providing insight into target marketing strategies.
